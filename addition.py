# This program performs addition and subtraction

# Asking the user for two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Performing addition
sum_result = num1 + num2
print("The sum of the numbers is:", sum_result)

# Performing subtraction
sub_result = num1 - num2
print("The difference of the numbers is:", sub_result)
