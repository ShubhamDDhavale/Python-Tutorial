Week 1: Python Backend Development Foundations
Focus on foundational Python skills and setting up a backend environment.

Day 1: Python Core Concepts

Review Python basics, including file handling, OOP, and exception handling.
Assignment: Write a program to process and analyze a CSV file and generate a summary report.


Day 2: Python Modules and Libraries

Explore libraries like os, sys, math, datetime, and json.
Assignment: Write a script to organize files in a directory based on file extensions.


Day 3: Building APIs with Flask (Introduction)

Create a basic Flask API with CRUD operations for a simple resource (e.g., books or products).
Assignment: Implement /add, /view, /edit, and /delete routes.


Day 4: FastAPI Basics (Alternative to Flask)

Learn FastAPI for building fast and scalable APIs.
Assignment: Create an API with FastAPI to manage tasks with endpoints for adding, listing, and deleting tasks.


Day 5: Using Python HTTP Libraries

Learn to make HTTP requests using requests and handle responses.
Assignment: Write a script to interact with a public API (e.g., fetch weather or cryptocurrency data).

Week 2: Database Management
Focus on using databases and integrating them with Python backend development.


Day 6: Introduction to Databases

Learn SQLite and perform CRUD operations directly with Python.
Assignment: Create a Python script to manage a small inventory database.


Day 7: SQLAlchemy (Object Relational Mapping - ORM)

Use SQLAlchemy for database integration in Flask and FastAPI projects.
Assignment: Add SQLAlchemy to the Flask or FastAPI app created earlier and implement database models.


Day 8: Advanced Database Queries

Explore joins, filters, and aggregations in SQLAlchemy.
Assignment: Extend your database app to generate reports like total tasks completed or inventory value.


Day 9: MongoDB with PyMongo

Learn to interact with NoSQL databases using PyMongo.
Assignment: Create a MongoDB-backed API to store and retrieve unstructured data (e.g., user activity logs).


Day 10: Caching with Redis

Learn to use Redis for caching and fast data access.
Assignment: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed API data in your Flask or FastAPI app.

Week 3: APIs, Asynchronous Programming, and Testing
Learn advanced backend programming concepts and tools.

Day 11: Creating RESTful APIs

Understand REST principles and build compliant APIs.
Assignment: Build a REST API for a book library with endpoints like /books, /books/<id>.


Day 12: Asynchronous Programming with Python

Learn async programming using asyncio and FastAPI.
Assignment: Create an async API endpoint that fetches data from multiple APIs simultaneously.


Day 13: Working with Background Tasks

Use Celery or FastAPI background tasks to handle long-running processes.
Assignment: Create a task that processes uploaded files in the background.


Day 14: Creating Your Own Python Library

Learn how to package and publish Python libraries.
Assignment: Write a small Python package to validate email addresses or format text, and publish it locally.


Day 15: Writing Tests for Your Backend

Use unittest or pytest to test your APIs and database integration.
Assignment: Write test cases for the CRUD operations of your database-backed API.


Week 4: Advanced Tools and Concepts
Explore advanced backend development techniques.

Day 16: Logging and Monitoring

Learn to log backend operations using Python’s logging module.
Assignment: Add logging to your Flask or FastAPI app to track API requests and errors.


Day 17: Message Queues with RabbitMQ or Kafka

Explore message queues and integrate them into a Python backend.
Assignment: Create a producer-consumer application using RabbitMQ to process user uploads.


Day 18: Data Serialization with Marshmallow or Pydantic

Serialize and validate API input/output.
Assignment: Use Marshmallow (Flask) or Pydantic (FastAPI) for input validation and serialization.


Day 19: Advanced Python Backend Libraries

Explore libraries like socket (for real-time communication) or multiprocessing (for parallel processing).
Assignment: Build a chat server using Python’s socket library.


Day 20: Build a Comprehensive Backend Project

Combine all your skills to build a complete backend system.
Assignment: Develop a Task Manager API with Flask or FastAPI that supports:
User management.
Task management.
Background task processing.
Caching with Redis.
Logging and testing.
